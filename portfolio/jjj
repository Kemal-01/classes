                I became interested in technology in elementary school. I spent a lot of time trying out many technologies and programming languages, but I saw myself as a future fron-tend web developer. This is the area I have paid the most attention to. I enjoy learning new technologies and acquiring new skills. I know the concepts of objectoriented programming such as polymorphism, inheritance and working with modules. 
                I like to cooperate with colleagues and hear the opinion of others on further work on the projects. I actively use github when working with a team. GNU/Linux is my daily driver and Iâ€™m enjoying while using open source software.
